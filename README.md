# JSIB

## General information
JavaScript imageboard, or JSIB for short, is an attempt to create an imageboard software that is based on javascript rather than PHP, python, perl etc.

I'd like to achieve this using as little third-party code code as possible. By that, I mean that this will be using, as much as I can manage it, vanilla javascript.

I don't intend to use any libraries like jQuery, or any non-standard server software such as node.js.

If it happens that vanilla javascript isn't suffice for a task, or is ludicrously complex, I may decide to start using a library.
